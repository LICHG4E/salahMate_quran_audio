# salahMate_quran_audio

This repository contains audio assets (MP3) for the salahMate Quran audio project.

Notes:
- The audio folders contain many large MP3 files. By default these folders are ignored in `.gitignore` to avoid exceeding GitHub's file-size and repo-size limits.
- If you want to include audio files, use Git LFS or host the audio separately (releases, S3, etc.).

How to push this project to GitHub (one-line summary):
1. Initialize repository and make initial commit (already done locally by the helper).
2. Create a remote repository on GitHub (via website or `gh` CLI).
3. Add the remote and push: `git remote add origin <URL>` then `git push -u origin main`.

If you'd like, I can:
- Create the GitHub repo for you (requires GitHub CLI or a token).
- Configure Git LFS for MP3s and help push large files.
